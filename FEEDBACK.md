# Project Improvements & Feedback

Use this file to list the major problems and improvements needed for the application.
We will address them one by one.

## High Priority / Major Problems
- Pushing to GitHub never seems to work, its broken. Also push the commits one by one.
- The report fonting and page size is terrible. It should be fixed.


## Improvements / Polish
- [x] Add language selection (primarily Turkish). (Implemented)
- [x] Theme selection animations can be added (For example while switching from Dark to Light). (Implemented)
- [x] Menu looks boring, it should be more modern and eye-catching. (Implemented)

## Future Ideas
- [x] Research on possible model switching options through the app. (Implemented)
- Can we implement a new function to the app, transcription of the entire video, word to word.
- Deploy it with Netify, not as an app.
- Maybe find a free (on my end) API, to replace the current one. So that the tool works without entering an API key.
